video will be seen in a way that images are made in HDM and Table are made in HDM So, if you like the video, I know that you like YouTube videos very less But if you do, thanks to you all, I get the motivation to bring free courses like this So, let's start the 5-way video of Sigma Web Development Codes in computer screen Well, let's roll the intro So, guys, I am here in my computer screen, you can see that First of all, I want to show you that Getup.com slash code with diary In fact, you can read the repository So that you can get all the code Second thing is, click on the playlist and read the book Click here and save it on the star Now, I will tell you the first thing I will tell you about the image In the image of the HTML, what we will do is We will make a folder from here New folder and video file You can come here and click on the shift Open with code is very useful I will tell you already But if you want to see any of these You can not get the notification of the new page So, click on the show welcome page on startup And you will not get the notification of this time But what we are doing is We will make a bit of a control of the index road HTML We will zoom in and do a screen cast We will do a sport of the screen So that you will know what kind of button I am in And why I am in the same way Now, I have taken the exclamation mark and I have taken the image abbreviation And I will do a view word wrap here I will have to work hard to do it You can see here that this is your word wrap It has been turned on So, what will happen here is that it will not be a horizontal skull Now, what I will do here I will write images First, I will write images here And I will simply do what I will do here I will take an image Now, I can get an image from the internet I will write here Let us take an image from the image Train Train images Because we have run a lot of trains in this course So, we will write the images of the train I will do a save image And here, Sigma Web Development Course In the video number 5 folder This is a CMS file In fact, I will do a work So, I will do a cancel I will take a snap Because I am going to go to a CMS extension I will also go to a PNG So, I have taken a Windows shift And this is the way If you do not know the sleeping tool And if you do not know Now, you will know Sigma Web Development Course You will know that if you will take a Windows shift And this is the way So, your sleeping tool will open in Windows Who knows Do not know the comment section I will explain it to you Okay, now what will we do here? I have done a Windows shift S And then I have started talking So, click here And save it here Or save the floppy disk option Now, click here And go to the downloads Go to Sigma Web Development Course And save the video 5m Image Now, I have saved the image Now, in HTML, I am G Tag I am G As you will see, the SRC and all Both of these required attributes are there In fact, if you do not write all of them Then it will be recommended I will tell you what are the attributes First of all, if you write in SRC Image.png You can see that this image is there So, I put this image.png in the Alt And I put it in the Alt Train Image Okay, now if you want to show it to you Then you can preview it in browser So, you can see it in the same way This is our page And this is the image of this train What is the point of writing the Alt Where did it go? You can say I will tell you where it went The Alt that was inside So, the Alt that was inside You can see that it did not go in That too Manlo for some reason Server does not show you any image Okay? Manlo, I have written the image too Image.png file is not here So, what will be the error? What will be shown? So, the Alt that will be displayed And this way An error image will be displayed Which will tell you that You have put the image in the right place You have put it in the right place You have given it a little bit And here, the URL of the Seed Server Here, the image is not there Okay? This way, it looks like this And it shows the Alt there So, the user knows What is the purpose of this image? Okay? And if I come back here From here, you can put the Alt in the image You can put it in the Alt If I do not put the Alt, then it will be something If I do not put the Alt, then it will not be there So, this is the Alt that will not be there And nothing will happen So, you will not want When your server is in error, you will see the user image You will see This way And the scenario is made The user looks like you The train image is written like this Okay? I hope you understand So, the image is straight forward It has two more attributes Which are important So, it is a bit Which is a bit It is a bit in pixels So, 23 is equal to 23 So, you can see In fact, I will fix the image I will fix it first I have written the image too From image.png So, here you can see I have written 23 pixels Because it is very small So, I will fix it I do not need to click on the PX You can see When we write the weight We will see That we need to click on the PX Or, if we write the weight It is equal to double quotes Or, number Like you can see Okay? So, if I take it You can see That it is small I have written the image If I give it a height I mean, I give it a height But if I give it a height If I give it a height of 2030 Then it will be a bit more But if I am referring From here Just click It will be small Then you can see From here Then you can see The share\u904e\u53bb is A bit stretched No matter what The say The\ufffd\ufffd\uace0 It is also stil So, let's If you want These height Pens Low All this Is how many \u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c will go We always need to set one thing from the width of the height. When our page is loading, the image of the page is coming from the bottom of the image. I will tell you in the coming videos. But now you understand that these height and height attributes are not used. Many people say that they are not used to duplicate or duplicate. But I say that they should be used to do this purpose. Why should I tell you in the coming videos where I will tell you about core web vitals and SEO. Now you will see that the width of the image is going to be the same. The height of the image is the same. So the second one is automatically set. And these values are in pixels. And you don't have to write px or pixel. You have to write this number. And that's it. This is an attribute. It is a height and an SRC attribute. You can use a style attribute. In fact, style attribute is almost used with all the tags. So this is about the image. Now we will talk about the tables in HTML. HTML has a very useful table tag. What is the table tag? I will tell you. I will show you the table tag. I copy this table from here. And when I copy this table, you will see that the page is shown in this way. So this HTML table is called the page of my previous page. Here you see the name, Harry H. 100. Now if I add more things in the description. I will put the name in the description. And here I will add designation, Harry designation, and I will add the program. And I want to add more things in the description. I will use all ship bottom. I will use all ship bottom. And here I will write the favorite language. And here I will write the JavaScript. And now you see that this table will be made in this way. Name, destination, favorite language. So what is this? How do I tell you? Let me tell you. Here you see that table tag is not used. Table tag is called TR tag. Because table is rho. What will come in this rho? You will see that. Now if you want to use table heading. You say that this is table rho. This is rho. Name, destination, and favorite language. What will come in this rho? And what will come? What will happen? Now you can see that it will be a heading. So I will use TH. I mean table heading. And I will write this only once. And then we will write TH. And then we will add data. So we will add table rho in TD. Which stands for table data. And here you will add the entire TR in this way. So what will happen? Your rows will be added. So I will write here. Sam. And this is also a programmer. And you can see that this is the favorite language of Java. So this rows will be added in table. You can see that this rows are added. This is the same. We will see from CSS that how can it be ordered. But this is given from default. And we know that this is the next one. But you can see that table works in the same way. Now we will see the rows span and calls span attributes. Now you can see that the rows span means how much rows span your TD. For example, let us write here. I want Sam and programmer to write in the first one. I want to write in the second one. I want to write in the second one. So I will write in the second one. I don't want to write in the second one. And I want to write here that call span is equal to 2. So call span is equal to 2. So Sam will take 2 columns. What does that mean? Sam will take 2 columns. I will show you how to do the same. I will show you how to do it. So this is the whole column. So the call span means how many columns will be taken. By default, this column will take 1 cell. But sometimes 1 cell, 2 columns will take 1 cell. To demonstrate this thing, I will explain to you guys about the excel. In excel, you will understand that this table is HTML. Sometimes I want to spend 2 columns 1 data. So here we use merge cell. And here I write Sam. HTML is used in callspan. Sometimes we want to merge vertically. I mean I want to merge in 2 cells. We use rows span there. And whose rows span we will use? And we will use rows span. TD is obviously. So TD is used in callspan. And if we use rows span, we will use rows span. So this way we will span 2 rows. So I hope you guys understood. When we will make tables, we will make projects, HTML. Then you will understand more things. But I will show you how to do rows span here. So if I write rows span as equal to 2. And then I will write another TR here. So you will see that this table is shown in some way. Now I will explain better to do this. I will put a CSS style here. I will add a style sheet. And I will keep the style sheet. So you guys can also understand CSS style. I will tell you the same thing. I will write a border in TD. 2 pixel solid black. And you guys will know how to do it. But now you will understand that I have put it here. To explain. So I said that this is the Harry programmer JavaScript. Then I said that the Sam is the rows span. How much I had given the rows span? I said that the rows span of my Java would be 2 rows. So how much I had given the rows span? So I had given the rows span. So you can see that the rows span of Java are 2 rows. So when the rows span are 2 rows, I don't have the next one. Because I have already written the rows. So I will not write the next one. So I will not write the next one. I have given the rows span of this call span. So what can I do with this? This was Harry programmer JavaScript. He said that the Sam is the 2 columns that we will do. This is the Sam also. And the Java is the 2 rows. You can see that the exact same voice here. The 2 rows are the columns. So this is how the rows span of the column can be used in HTML. In HTML table, we can add captions. And to add captions, we can use some captions. So I will show you how to use the caption in the table. I will use the caption in student details. So you can see the page in the same way. You can see the caption in the same way. Now CSS changes the font size. But now you can see the caption in the same way. The caption is shown in the same way. You can also add header and footer. You can also add T-head or T-foot. If you add T-head or T-foot content in the same way. If I add header and footer in the same way. You can see the T-head and footer. You can see the header and footer. Now I will show you a more tech. I will show you a B-H-TAC line break. You can see the line break here. So this header is the footer. I will add the footer. I will not add it here. I will add the table and footer. Now I can change CSS. Now I can group the content of the header and footer. That is the header that I'll be using here. And he can group it up by adding the line conversationin his table above. When I apply T-head content within the whole table, he will be temosed it in the table. So how will itear in T-body content as far as I can see. Now I applied T-foot. When I want to add some data in all the edges, I will add T-I-R I can write that okay to add the footer right coming back on the screen, so I will document it in my table. I want to add TR and I want to group it in T-foot. So this is how it will group. I added T-foot, T-tards, T-body, T-head and T-head. I have not changed anything. I have just grouped it. I will write down the work I do here. I will write down the foot. I can write down the foot. The last one is the foot. What is the benefit of doing this? I have targeted from CSS. You will use it very less. But you can do it in a way. Your table will be held in the head. Foot will be held in the head. And the body will be held in the middle. But you can write it in any way. But ideally, head and foot will be held in the head. I hope you all understood. That is all about HTML tables. You don't need to know more about HTML tables. Now we will talk about list. There is a lot of important information in the list. Because the list will be used very much. There is a list in the list of 3. We have an ordered list. And there is a definition list. The first one is the un ordered list. Let's look at the un ordered list. Sometimes we want to have un ordered data. I will write the URL here. I will write the URL here. I can write it in the un ordered list. I can write it in the Harry. I can write it in the Rohan. And then I can write it in the Shubham. Okay? When I write Harry Rohan Shubham, I will write it in the un ordered list. Look, Harry Rohan Shubham is here. He has ordered it. There is no 1-2-3-4. But if you want to have an ordered list, I can write it in the same way. If I write it in the open-closing tag, and write the rest in the same way, it will be ordered list. Here, 1-2-3 will be here. You can do this 1-2-3. You can do this in the capital. You can do Roman numbers. You can do CSS with it. You can do this in the same way. You can see here, if you have a URL in the image, you can see the image. If you have a URL in the image, it is 1-2-3. This is an ordered list example. This is a definition list. It is a preview of the text. First, I have written it in the DL. DL means definition list. DT and DD. This definition is term. This definition is definition. This is something like this. You can change CSS. But you should know about this. For interviews, you should know what is a definition list. So, you should know about this. I am also writing it in the same way. But try it out. First, we will see the order list. You have to tell the order list. It is very simple and straightforward. You can use it in bullet points. You can use type-8. You can use type-8. I am writing type-2. In UL, type-2 is equal to square. I have written in the UL type-2. In this way, you can use the type-2. This is a disk by D. This is a disk by D. I can also use the model-2. This is a disk by D. I can also use it in this way. I can also use the model-2. You can add more list items in this list. Now let's see the order list. You can write the LIs in the order list.
