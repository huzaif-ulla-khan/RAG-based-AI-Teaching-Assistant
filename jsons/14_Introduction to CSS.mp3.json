decline your interest in this video Like this video and write a comment in the comments section with high energy If you are maintaining such high energy throughout the course CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets And with the help of Cascading Style Sheets, we implement HTML It was never intended to create styled pages That is, the work of HTML was created from the beginning That they build a basic structure of the website And then the CSS is taking responsibility to style the page The selectors of CSS are the ones who help select some element I'll tell you what the selector is like in this video And in the coming videos, we are going to raise the bar like anything We'll make real-world websites Like the website of Amazon, Blip, Netflix, YouTube You'll be able to make all these websites So I'm very excited Let's go to the computer screen Let's go to the intro So I'm going to make a folder here And I'll make a video of 14 more fun in this course Because I've never made a copy of the mainstay Now, I'll tell you about the CSS Why you'll use CSS? It was never intended to style the pages It was always intended to create a skeleton It was a lot of tags like HTML that were deprecated Like font tags Because HTML was responsible for creating a skeleton website That's about it The work of the thing is to take all the CSS In this video, we'll make real-world websites If you haven't done the playlist access yet, Sores code is here Code with Harry.com slash notes If you go there, you'll download HTML notes You'll get additional things to see So you'll click on PDF notes You'll get PDF notes of HTML It's written in my handwriting It's written in 100 notes So download all the notes And I'll put a link in the description I told you about the HTML that is the body of the car The car is made of paper So CSS is the paint, decoration, designs, seeds, interior And what is JavaScript? Engine and internal logic Let's talk about engine and internal logic We've done HTML and CSS Now, I'll tell you more examples Like how humans are body It's a skeleton in human body You have HTML, skin, hair, hair You all understand CSS And our brain, our nerves, our neurons All of them are used to constitute JavaScript So I hope that everything is clear So, I'll find the HTML that is never intended to style websites This is the CSS that has taken me The HTML of CSS has taken me a lot I've come here and I'll help in styling So, CSS has taken me a lot To style pages So, I'll download the notes Car, spoiler, alert, notes, CSS is also a burden But listen to me first Downloading it later I've given the spoiler But don't download it now I've given it a lot of time I've taken it from a lot of work So, you see, things are going to get a lot And I've made this level of codes I'm ready So, after that I'll try to shift and click on open with code So, here The video is 14th folder It's open in my VS code Now, I'll make a file in index.html And mark an exclamation mark Or, just like the boilerplate code We used to keep doing HTML course Like we do with HTML videos And I'll write CSS in title And I'll write a div in the body Hey, I am Harry And today I am in CSS mood Okay, I'll write it here So, here I'll click on preview You can see here Hey, I am Harry and today I am in CSS mood So, what is CSS? You can add CSS basically Use style tech And use it What are two more ways Because I'll tell you in the videos I'll tell you a lot of things Now, if I say The div The div Color it red I'll say it red The div is color red So, it's the div inside the div What is this selector? And this is our declaration So, selector and declaration What is the div? That is, all the colors of this page Which are our What is our value? This is our property This is our value's property Red it red So, this is our declaration And this is our selector So, you guys understood So, now I'll show you the page So, see the color of this red Because I said The color of this page is red So, if I make a second div here And write it in it I am good So, this is our good color Which you can see And add another declaration in this And write it in here And write it in background yellow And here, this background is yellow And this background is yellow And this selector will match That element background is yellow And you can see here I said div And here was div And here was div And here, I'll make a span And write it in here I am also good So, what will happen? So, will this be red? No, this color will not be red Because this selector And these declarations Are not applicable on these elements Okay There is no element Which is not div Okay, then I'll add a paragraph And add a lawm 435 Oops I think 435 is too much 43 is enough Okay, so, I added a lot of lawm in here Because our page will be too big And this declaration Is not applied And this is not applied I just said div That's why all these conditions are applied Now, here, how can I select multiple elements I can select different span So, divorce span will be red And here, background color will be yellow What is divorce span? My selector So, in multiple selectors This declaration is applied This is property Background color is property Which is value yellow Color is property which is value red Okay So, you can see Where there will be div Where there will be span Where there will be things And that's pretty much how CSS works That's it So, what will I learn in the coming videos Is this property And this is selected I'll tell you about different selectors That's about it It's as simple as that And using these selectors We have Amazon as a website We have Flipkart as a website We have Facebook as a website And then, Instagram as a website All these can be made And today, in the market There are such technologies Which you can make And make mobile apps By coding like this You can make mobile apps All these things can be explored There are very extensive levels of course It will be fun You guys are also Touching so many things We will be doing You guys were giving an exercise In video number 12 So, if you guys didn't post your answer You will definitely post your answer soon Because I am going to give shout out Which comment will post your answer in your answer Make sure that you go to video 12 And solve pure HTML player Which will solve your exercise Because if you have two interactions It will be fun I will give shout out And you guys will do a solution It will be fun So, please do solve this Now, I want to tell you about the replicate Many people say that we have a phone We have a laptop Many people have a problem So, there are repeated days An amazing platform Which you can try out You simply have to sign up And you will be able to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript And it is very big I have used it For my production and great projects And in this channel, you guys have shown a lot of videos And have shown it on the app So, we have done a 100 days of code And have done it on the app So, you can use it If you don't have a laptop Or you are coding in your phone It will be a good experience So, guys, I have a comment section You guys will write that it is fun Or not in the software discourse Because I want to comment all of you In the comment section That it is fun We are doing the access to this playlist We are doing the source code I have updated all the videos of the source code And I will give you a shout out And you guys will be able to name both of them Thank you so much guys Watching this video And I will see you next time Thanks for watching"}
