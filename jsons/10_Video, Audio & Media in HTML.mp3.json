We have seen in our very first video that we can embed videos in kestana. Today I will tell you how to auto play kestana. How to make muted video and how to enable and disable the control of video. Along with that we will also see about audio. How to show media in overall page. Like this video and subscribe to our channel. Because the examples I have used for video tags are very important. Let's go to video screen and let's roll the intro. Friends I have made a video called Folder. I will not waste time with the open with code of shift right click. I will make impact index on the stream. Today's video is video. How to play video. In a HTML file, how to put video. How to put audio. How to put media. So to add video, I will copy it. The video tag is called src attribute. And some other attributes like this. I will show you the slowest. But first I will tell you. You will see the video. If you have video.mp4, you will play with it. I have video.mp4. Let's see. I have put control here. I will preview it. You can see that this video is here. Now it is a very big video. So what can I do? I can say that I will do it here. I will do it here. I will do it here. I need to click px. I don't need to click px. I don't need to click px. I will do it here. I will do it here. I will do it here. So that it will be small. I will do it here. I will do it here. Now I will play it. I can play it here. I have a good role in this. What is my name? Open isrojogi. Where did you go? I went to U.S. I went there. Open isrojogi. You can play video like this. Now I will use some attributes. You should use a video deck. You should have a video. The video you have given me. You will have control. You can download it. You can mute it. You can picture it. This is automatically presented. I will tell you about some attributes. You can see that I will put the video file here. This video file can be used externally. If I upload the video here. You can download it. You can also use the file in your computer. You can also use the server. You can also use the third party. Now what is the controls? Ads video controls play pause and volume. Because we saw that in the video. You are seeing the controls. Now what is the thing? It looks automatically. What will be the control led? What will not be in your video? It will automatically play. You can also use the audio. I will put the audio. What is the problem? What is the problem? You can see that the audio is played here. I will put the audio here. The next attribute is loop. Once we play the video. It will be loop. I will show you. The audio is played here. The audio is played here. Once I play the video. I will start with the same. This is the loop. The next attribute is mutate. I will mute the video. If I click mute. I want to add videos here. I will add videos here. I will add videos here. I will demonstrate something. I will use the mutate attribute. I will not record the video. I will show you. I will show you. I will highlight the video. I will highlight the video. I will mute the video. You can use the mutate attribute in your websites. The post is very important. I will have a image here. Download.jpg If I write here. Post is equal to Download.jpg You will see something. I will play this post. I will play this post. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. I will show you. Post is equal to Download. I will read it in the description. I will put the videos here. I will recommend. I will let you know in the following video. I will use it in the following video. I will make a website. I will give you a quick quiz in the end. I will give you a quick quiz so that I forget I will give you this and it will be very fun to do and everyone should be curious about it but before that you write like audio and src and put in src I will put in src and src I will reload and here audio is not strange src is equal to mini I have to check the controls I will not see audio now I will see the controls I can set the volume and play this audio what is the difference between src and src? it is not good if we mute it I can do it it is not good now we will see what we will do in this audio you will know that the source video file is cut pin i will able to do it i will play it i will play it i want to play Wow i wanted to read it after of that i will fast ban the minipura What is the truth? So you said repeat it. Once you have saved it, then you can save it from the second. Because I have already downloaded it. So you have seen this. I have downloaded the truth and the MP3. Once you have saved it. Then you have saved it. What is the truth? The MP3 is the same. So, when you want the MP3 to repeat it, then you can use it. Then you can use it. Then you can mute it. And you definitely don't want to buy default. You mute most of the cases. But we will never want the audio muted. And we can use it here. You will hear it and mute it. What is the truth? We do this. You can mute the audio with 5 or 6 seconds. You can mute the user with your play. You can use it when you want. You can use it. You can use it for all. You have been given the right time. You have enjoyed it. You have been confused. So, I explained this code to you. You can make this value of pre-load attribute. This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio at all. If you want to fetch the browser data. Now you will use preload attribute or preload attribute. Preload is equal to non default value. Preload is equal to meta data. Browser is not only meta data. The audio file will load the information about it. Because it will load from the beginning. And what will be done by auto? Preload will be all the audio. Preload is equal to auto. If it is downloaded, it will be loaded automatically. So that whenever you play the user, it will be saved. Preload is equal to non default value. And it is very common for preload attributes. So you should know what preload attribute is. Before we start, I want you to share this playlist with your friends. I am seeing that it is very difficult to get the details. We are going to start videos. I hope you like this video. And with that, you can start the repository. Your star will help you to get the likes of your star. So this was about audio and video tags. I told you all the attributes. And you should definitely use all the images I will give you. So that you can try out these things. Many people asked us that we can use replicas. I have not used replicas in this course. But replicas.com is an amazing website. If you want to use it in your phone, you can use it. If you want to use HTML, you can use it in your app. For iOS, Android, you can try it out. People have not asked me how to record in your phone. But I am also trying to use the most of the people who prefer to use it. So I have made videos in the VSCorn. But personally, I use replicas. And there are videos in the replicas. Next topic is SVG. What is SVG? SVG is a format. You can create a very high graphics vector images. You can create a circle in this. So SVG is used in the same way. It is used in the same way. I am using it. If I add SVG, SVG will come here. So SVG and the circle will come here. Video, audio, SVG are the online elements. So we are looking at the same line. Now, what is here? You can save SVG file from different types. You can save SVG file from different types. I will write here that I amg.svg and SVG content is saved. So if I write here I amg.svg and I will write this. And I will write this in the same way. So you can see here that I have not seen it. If I write here, and write my SVG image, then you can see that SVG has come here. But SVG is not able to see it. Why? Because SVG is in SVG file in browser. And SVG file, you can see that you will see in browser. So you will see a declaration. So I have written here that SVG file not showing. So here the stack and the block is a concern. So you will have to write this. I will show you XML in some way. You will have to add this. Name space declaration. So SVG is something you will have to add. And you can see here that SVG has seen. So this is very important and many people will make websites in future. So I will write in this problem. So I am telling you that the problem you faced in the first story. You have not faced the problem. I have also told you that solution is going to come. The next topic is I frames. I frames are very simple. You can embed a second website from I frames. I want to embed this web page. I can use it from I frame. I will copy this URL. And I will paste it here. And you can see that the entire website is embedded. You will definitely want to embed it in a bigger I frame. But if you want to embed it from I frame. I will increase the height of this. So width is equal to width. I will add it to the width. I will add it to the height of this. I will add it to the height of this. Okay. So this is something like this. So this is what I was expecting. So this is what I am expecting. I will add it to the width. I will add it to the width. So this is the entire site. You can embed this website. You can use it from I frame. You can share this video with your friends. If you want to embed it, you can give it to the I frame. And you can start it from any side. If you want to start a particular time, you can do it here. At this point, you can share it with your friends. You can share it with your friends. I want to start this video. I will do this video here. I will do this in the share. I will do this in the embed. I will start it in the 1219. I will copy it. I will put it in the code. I will comment this in the I frame. I will add it to the I frame. I will drop it in the code. So that you can see the size of the code. Now I will do what I will do. After paste it, I will show you the document. See, this video is here. It is embedded. So I hope that you will come to this point. And the media is only available in HTML. I am pretty much. I will get to see a lot of things in every topic. But that's all about media. HTML, audio, media is not that important. This is what you will use in 95% of the time. Now I will give you a quick quiz. Your quick quiz is to create a website which shows videos of different categories. And audio of different categories. You can use YouTube videos in an I frame using YouTube's embedding feature. So what you have to do is you will have to create a website which will give you a lot of content. Now you will use video audio tags and use this shared feature of YouTube. So I have created this video embedding. You can also embed it in this way. And I will make a very big website and show you. You can give me a comment of the chart and you can explain it with it. You can explain it to me in a code. But you need to try this quiz. And write in the comment section, access the playlist. And like this video. Write a lot of questions. Now I will make a video with you. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."}
