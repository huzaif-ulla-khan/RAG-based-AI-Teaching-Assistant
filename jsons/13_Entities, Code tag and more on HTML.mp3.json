your web development journey After that, we'll start the video with CSS I'm doing a lot of things in the HTMLL, I'm excited You guys like this video and write a signature patch in the comments section Let's go to the computer screen Let's roll the intro Guys, as you can see, I'm in the computer screen And I'll make a new folder of Bina Time Which is called my video 13 I'll open the VSCode by clicking the shift in it And I'll make a file Index.html Okay? Now I've got index.html here I'll tell you the file Now I want to tell you a little bit about it There are a lot of things in the HTML Which you guys have to explore I'll tell you something And I'll include the rest of the HTML If you want to know in the HTML I'll add the word wrap and then add the screen cast mode If you want to know in the HTML This is 3 is greater than 4 Okay? I want to know in the HTML If you want to know in the HTML I'll show you the preview So this is 3 is greater than 4 Okay? Now I'll write here This is the code for paragraph Okay? And I'll write something like this I've written here Okay? I want you to appear Okay? You see? This will not appear Why not? Because how can I know how to write the paragraph I want to write the code in paragraph Or I want to use this as a syntax in actual So this is for the reason For HTML and ITs What do I tell you in HTML and ITs? If you write the ampersand LT-Semicolon LT-FOR-LESS-DEN You can write it as LT-Semicolon But if you write the ampersand LT-Semicolon And replace it with the ampersand LT-Semicolon And the greater than simple as you replace it You can show the ampersand LT-Semicolon I'll show you what I'll do If you replace it with the ampersand LT-Semicolon Then what will happen? That this is the way the actual way is written You can see here And you can zoom here Okay? So what happens? HTML and LT-S are used For writing those things Which are used to highlight HTML syntax What does it mean? If we write paragraph of tag code here How will HTML know this paragraph of tag code? Or do you want to write this thing as it is? Okay? For this there is a pre-tack If you put it in pre-tack And you write here And then P This is a paragraph Okay? So if you write it like this Then this will come as it is You can see it This will come as it is And along with that If you write new lines here This is after few new lines Okay? And some more If you write it like this So you can see This will come as it is All the spaces are intact All the new lines are intact But here it will show the tag For tags we will have to use the entities So this is pre-tack HTML So we have seen the entities If you want to put the symbol of copyright You can write the ampersand copy of the semicolon And as you can write the ampersand copy of the semicolon Then you can see the symbol of copyright here Which you can see Okay? So you can do this with HTML and Tagdys So you can try all these examples To do non-breaking spaces Along with that You can see the special symbols of copyright We have seen the ampersand nbsp For space it is used And it is very important So if I write here Copyright Okay? I will write here Copyright I know I want For some reason I will write here And I will write here Code with Harry Okay? So I will write in the Code with Harry So this space will only be a space In HTML, if there are extra space It will be ignored So you see that you have sent the code with the code after copyright But ideally we will not want it We will want it We will want it to be the space Which I have put in the press So you press spaces You press ampersand nbsp You press m in the press and nbsp You will get so many space So you see it is going to be the space So you need to put literally space in your HTML code Ampersand nbsp is something You should go after Okay? So you see You can also use this breaking space as a result, like less than greater than this, and then what is the quotation tag? You can use quotation tag as a result, and I will also tell you the example of quotation tag. You can also use quotation tags as well. You can also use quotation tags as well. You can also use this as a style. What you will have, you can also use quote tag to cite it. Similarly you can also use quote tag here to cite it. You also have to cite such simply, it's a VISTA article, and if you either\u044b\u043b's or married population will also cite it, or if you want to cite it, it's together approved of tags used. And this criticism is ours because it's an extracting tag. Some collectivate tag exists, which has been absolutely observed, You can handle the CSS size of the phone. You can't use the phone tag. You can use many attributes like color size, and you can use the phone tag. But it's not recommended. You can use the phone tag. The center tag is recommended in the center. Now I will recommend the CSS. The flags are great. The modern CSS is good. The tags are good. But you should know that. You can use the code tag. I hope that helps. Then code tag. You can use the code tag. You can use the code tag. You can use the code tag. If you want to use the code tag. I will tell you that I am using a prism CSS. I will tell you how to use it. PrismJS. Prism.JS. This is an old unit by CRSR. I have used the code tag. If you want to use and write code tag. If you want to write source code tag, you can write code tag.\u5f53 \u041a\u043e\u0440Hdng1. If you want you can understand. Now you can copy and paste the code and paste it Now you can paste the multi-line code in your pre-cord So that the new lines are intact I will select a code here I will select python code I will select HTML code I will select control and then select this I will select the exclamation mark and paste it I will select HTML and paste it I will select this as HTML boilerplate code So if I preview it So here this is HTML boilerplate could actually render If I want to write as retis So what I have to do is I will replace this less than the sign I will do the right click change of the current And what I will do here Ampercent LT-SAMICOLAN You can tell it is LT-SAMICOLAN And also the greater than the symbol is I will paste this code here I can't do as retis So this is important Now you can see the code is here So you can copy any code You can also note the pre-tack If you want to select this space You can select shift or tap So shift or tap can be reduced So you can do this And then backspace And then backspace And then backspace And then backspace And now you can see the code is here And you can use this as a style I will tell you how to use the libraries I will tell you how to use libraries I will show you some tags I want to tell you about the tags I want to tell you about the tags Now the characters I will use them Then what is canvas Basically the canvas The use of canvas is used in JavaScript But you can understand That it is an element in HTML Which makes graphical shapes I hope you all know In this video, HTML is completely loaded And you will know Now we will do CSS HTML is already completed I hope you all are enjoying All the source code is uploading on the GitHub So please access it And if you don't have to access this playlist Click here and click on the bookmark Or click on the save Now you can see the video Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you Bye"}
